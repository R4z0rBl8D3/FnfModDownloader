# Friday-Night-Funkin-Mod-Downloader
This is a WPF program I wrote in C#. It can download fnf weeks, or mods. There is also a manage window where you can see all your weeks or mods that are downloaded. You can open them, delete them, or you can reinstall them (if you want to reset it or you broke the game).
